1. Get seed triangle from user
2. Find a MLE distribution on edge lengths.
3. Choose two length by sampling from distribution
4. From exterior points of graph: Randomly choose a pair of adjacent points.
5. Compute extra point
6. Add new point to data structure

Repeat



# Data structures

set of points :: (x,y) coordinates
set of edges [point,point]
list of exterior points [point,point,point ... point]
