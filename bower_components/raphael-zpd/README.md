# Raphaël-ZPD
### A little plugin for the [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/) Javascript SVG library enabling canvas-wide zoom, pan and drag functionality.

## Usage

Instantiate a RaphaelZPD object by passing it the Raphael paper context in which to operate, and an object expressing the desired options:

	var zpd = new RaphaelZPD(paper, { zoom: true, pan: true, drag: true });

The options object can be accessed following initialisation as zpd.opts. You may disable the drag functionality on the basis of individual Raphaël elements like so:

	el.node.draggable = false;

## Potential Issues

The coordinates given by mouse events are still relative to the SVG canvas itself. The plugin works around this by adding zoomedX and zoomedY properties to all such events, which are correctly transformed.

The ZPD function works by creating an SVG group element (with id 'viewport' + n) and overriding the constructors on the default Raphäel elements to place them within. Clearly, this technique won't work with VML. If you want to use the plugin with a browser that does not natively support SVG, it is suggested that you investigate [svgweb](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/).

## Examples

[Treeblob](http://www.lemma.org/experiments/treeblob/) is a contrived example of network visualisation using the panning and zooming functionalities.
